They also gave us a complimentary dessert.\\n\\nBut per person, the set menu is AED 270, which seems wildly inflated for the quality of dishes put out.

We took the share option for four and let me tell you, it was amazing! The quality of the food was out of this world, this is a lot of food for the price. Our waiter‚Äôs name was Sujiht (I‚Äôm sorry if I misspelled it). He was so attentive to details and amazing. This was one of the best Indian food I had in my life. Could highly recommend this place!! If I could have given more than 5 stars, I would have.\\n Rating: 5\\nThis popped on my phone from a year ago and I thought I'd share my thoughts because of how much I am missing this!\\n\\nAsha's is a little bit on the fancy/expensive side of Indian cuisine but it is totally worth it if you consider the quality of food/service and the restaurant's atmosphere.\\n\\nI am not the biggest fan of lentil but their lentil soup was one of the best I've ever had compared to other places. The chicken tikka masala and tandoori did not disappoint and if you love refreshing drinks and coconut you will probably enjoy their backwater delight because it used coconut pur√©e and that in my book is tasty!\\n\\nOverall, delicious food and if you are wondering about the price range, it was around 250dhs but we were two and it was alot of food.\\n Rating: 5\\nThis is out of the world restaurant!!! Each and every dish ordered had its uniqueness and exquisite taste. The service is top notch, very friendly and patient in explaining each dish on the menu. Not to mention the hygiene and cleanliness was outstanding. I love this place!\\n Rating: 5\\nExquisite food and service! I came for quick lunch as I had an errand to run. I asked if I can be served quickly to be able to be on time. The manager/supervisor not sure sent me a waiter before I even got to sit. He then came twice to check that I was attended and that the food was good. Place is sooo cozy and tables have lots of privacy. I ordered summer salad which was very delicious and yellow dhaal which i liked so much. Definitely visiting again. Served by ADIL and ROOPAKüëçüèª\\n Rating: 5\\nI recently dined at Asha‚Äôs, an Indian restaurant, and I must say, it was an exceptional experience. From the moment we entered, the service was impeccable. The staff was attentive and friendly, making sure we had everything we needed throughout the meal.\\n\\nNow, let's talk about the food ‚Äì it was simply amazing! We opted for the 200AED meal which included soup, curry, grill, biryani, water, and bread. Every dish was bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection. My personal favorite was the soup; it was rich, flavorful, and left me craving for more.\\n\\nOverall, Asha‚Äôs exceeded my expectations with its delicious food and top-notch service. If you're craving authentic Indian cuisine in a welcoming ambiance, Asha‚Äôs is definitely the place to go.\\n\"),\n",

The duck was pretty good too but perhaps could have had a bit more depth of flavour / be charcoal smoked, but the duck fried rice they make hit the spot (having had awesome food in HK or London). The char siu probably lacked an extra hit of hoi sin/ bean paste and honey for that extra flavour but wasn‚Äôt bad.\\n\\nOverall, like going here for solid Chinese food and prices aren‚Äôt the cheapest but you‚Äôre at the Rosewood.\\n Rating: 5\\nCame for set lunch and ended up having the all you can eat dim sum menu both priced at 128\\nFood was great and plentiful, come with an empty stomach - the all you can eat stops at 14:30\\n Rating: 5\\nAs a Chinese, I would say this is more authentic Chinese food!
