What I liked the most is that the staff were really friendly and professional, they’re smart and knowledgeable about how to make the customer happy. The atmosphere is both cosy and classy, the food was good , with small portions, so don’t expect to get a full stomach after visiting. But the experience itself what makes this place special. Oh and one more thing, they took for us a very nice photograph at the end of the evening.\\n Rating: 3\\nWe had the Iftar set menu and the main course was underwhelming. Pasta was undercooked, the chicken (though cooked to perfection) was served just as is, without any vegetables or greens on the side. When we gave feedback, they heard us and asked if they could get us another plate, but we declined. They also gave us a complimentary dessert.\\n\\nBut per person, the set menu is AED 270, which seems wildly inflated for the quality of dishes put out. The desserts though (date cake and cheesecake), were phenomenal and we were happy that we could end the meal on a good note.\\n\\nI would give this 2.5 stars but redeemed to 3 because the staff were impeccable.\\n Rating: 5\\nIt was a pity we had to sit inside because of the heat since the restr. is right by the shore.

The burrata was creamy and perfectly balanced by the sweetness of the cherry tomatoes. It was a refreshing and delectable way to begin our meal.\\nNext, we had the Margherita pizza. The crust was thin and crispy, the tomato sauce was rich and tangy, and the fresh basil added a wonderful aromatic touch. Each bite was a testament to the restaurant's dedication to quality ingredients and traditional preparation.\\nThe highlight of the meal was the linguine alla Romettese. The pasta was cooked to perfection, and the sauce was bursting with robust flavors. It was evident that great care was taken in crafting this dish, making it an absolute must-try.\\nWhile the prices at Prego's are on the higher side, the quality of the food and the overall dining experience justify the cost.

The food was delicious and the experience was amazing. We started with beef carpaccio and fried squid, which were both really good. The burger was tasty and meaty, and the baklava was the perfect dessert with its ice cream show. It had a crunchy and flaky texture without being too sugary. Overall, it was a great meal and a fun night. Although the ambiance and sitting area could be improved, I still loved the whole food experience. I will definitely come back to this place or try another Nusr et restaurant. Cheers! 🐰\\n\"),\n",
